HAWK: Hunting Automated Workflow Kit
Description
HAWK (Hunting Automated Workflow Kit) is a streamlined tool for discovering and assessing potential XSS vulnerabilities. It automates the process of URL harvesting, filtering, and testing using powerful third-party tools. HAWK simplifies recon and testing, saving results in Output.txt for manual or automated analysis.

Features
Global access: Run HAWK from anywhere in your terminal.
Simple help flag: hawk -h displays usage instructions and notes scan duration.
Automated URL gathering from:
Wayback Machine
OTX (Open Threat Exchange)
Katana
Filters URLs with gf xss, cleans them with uro, and tests them with Gxss and kxss.
Automatically installs and configures required tools on first use.
Results saved to Output.txt in the current directory.
Prerequisites
Supported OS: Linux (e.g., ParrotOS, Kali, Ubuntu).
Required Tools:
Waybackurls
Katana
Gf
Uro
Gxss
Kxss
API Key for OTX:
Create an account and generate an API key at OTX AlienVault.
Add the key during the script's first run or manually in the configuration file (~/.hawk_config).
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HAWK.git
cd HAWK
Make the script executable:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x hawk.sh
Add to PATH: Run the script once, and it will automatically add itself to /usr/local/bin, allowing global execution:

bash
Copy
Edit
./hawk.sh
Usage
Run the script with a target domain:

bash
Copy
Edit
hawk <target-domain>
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
hawk xss-game.appspot.com
For help:

bash
Copy
Edit
hawk -h
Configuration
The script will prompt for an OTX API key during its first run.
Alternatively, manually add the API key to the configuration file:
bash
Copy
Edit
nano ~/.hawk_config
Add:
makefile
Copy
Edit
OTX_API_KEY=<your-otx-api-key>
Next Steps
Manual Testing:
Open Output.txt to review and validate suspicious URLs.
Further Automation:
Use tools like XSStrike or XSpear for advanced XSS testing.
